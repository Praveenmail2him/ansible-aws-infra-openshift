| AD-01 | What automation tool should be used to automate the build? | Needs to be ansible (constraint). Not all commands available as modules. | 1. Ansible AWS modules, 2. Ansible with AWS CLI, 3. Combination of both  | 3. Combination | Allows best of both worlds | nil | |
| AD-02 | Should ROSA be installed as standard (public & private) or PrivateLink architecture? |  PrivateLink only suppported on existing VPCs. PrivateLink does not allow internet access from VPC hosting ROSA cluster. | 1. Use default, 2. Use PrivateLink, 3. Use standalone OCP | 1. Use Default | FS CLoud architecture has internet access in the same VPC as ROSA | Need to augment ROSA created VPCs once cluster is created | |
| AD-03 | VPN Gateway or Transit Gateway for customer data center connectivity? | A VPN gateway allows IPSec onnectivity to a single VPC. Limited control by VPN Gateway. Transit Gateway hosted in AWS global private network. | 1. VPN Gateway, 2. Transit Gateway | 2. Transit Gateway | Provides better control over traffic and allows routing between multiple VPCs which are required for this architecture. Allows use of corporate DNS for name resolution through traffic routing. | Higher cost for transit gateway ||
